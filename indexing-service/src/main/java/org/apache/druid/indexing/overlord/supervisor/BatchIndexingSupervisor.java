/**
 * TODO: Motivation:
 *  - batch supervisor as an analog of streaming supervisor
 *  - ties in to the indexing template
 *  - remove duplicate code
 * <p>
 * TODO: tasks:
 *  - Wire up CompactionSupervisor
 *  - Wire up Multi Rule
 *  - Run tests for both
 *  - Wire up scheduled batch
 *  - Write embedded tests for all
 * <p>
 * TODO: OVERALL FLOW:
 *  - Scheduler runs every 5 s (or triggered?)
 *  - Get target datasource of supervisor
 *  - Get the timeline
 *  - Ask supervisor to create jobs
 *    - For compaction:
 *    - Pass period, timeline and other stuff to compactible iterator
 *    - CompactionJobTemplate knows how to create a compaction job
 *    - For each candidate, create a job
 *  - Ask the supervisor which jobs can be run now
 *    - If current job requires more slots than available, should we check later jobs?
 *      - I guess so ü§∑üèª
 *    - Filter out intervals that are locked, already running or recently done or something
 *  - Run them
 *  - If skipped, track reason somewhere
